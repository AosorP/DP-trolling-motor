  The printNumber function uses two overloaded functions that keep your column-numbers
  steady, regardless of size or sign, by converting each number to a string then
  pre-padding each column-width with spaces. The column-widths, which are currently
  set to 6 may be altered by changing each "6" to "whatever-the-number-will-fit-into".

  The overloaded functions accept "float" and "short" numbers.

    Serial.print(" ");
  }
  Serial.print(myString);

// ----- Routine to stop floats jumping around

  String myString = String(number);
  short numberChars = myString.length();
