# DP-trolling-motor
Dynamic positioning on sea with GPS based electrical trolling motor
You can get curent GPS position and store it in your Android APP and Arduino MEGA
You can reload last GPS position from Android APP to Mega or enter the new coordinates
You can pick the point on the Open source map in Android APP and send it to MEGA
You can usit as position holding on sea like electric ancorage "Spot Lock" like Minn Kota, or similar
You can use it as autopilot that takes you to desired position on map
you can learn the track and fallow that track in looops
You can go in circle by entering the radius of circle
You can go in spiral
You can use JOG function in combination with Android phone properly aligned with the boat that can sense the orientation of the boat 
The hardware i used:
GPS sensor: NEO-6 or higher
Digital compass: LSM303DHLC or LSM303AGR
Bluetooth module: HC-05 (HC-06) 
STEPPER MOTOR: NEMA17 17HS19-2004S1 (fit the 3D printed case)
STEPPER MOTOR DRIVER: DRV8825 or equivalent
Arduino mega 2560 
Fyearfly 3D Printer Heater Controller mosfet driver 30A with PWM imput from Mega
GPS antena
Electrical trolling motor up to 30A, for higher you will need stronger motor driver
Gear box that will roatate the troling motor in desired dimension
